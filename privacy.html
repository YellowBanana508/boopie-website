        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>Introduction&nbsp;</b>
          <br>Boopie - Dashboard is a website that provides a friendly interface to control and modify how your Boopie behaves in a Discord server. "You" refers to the person reading this Privacy Policy or accessing this website. "Owner" or "bot owner" refers to any person(s) who has access to the website/service files or to the Boopie's program/service files.<br>
          <br>This Privacy Policy applies to you whenever you access this Boopie's Dashboard website/service or any other Boopie's website/services. This Privacy Policy will detail to you:<br>
          <br>What information is collected about you as a user, when you browse this website.<br>How this information is collected and used.<br>What/how this information is stored whether on your device or in a backend server.<br>How you may request for your data to be deleted.<br>If you wish for this website to not collect, store or use your information in any way, shape, form or fashion as described in this Privacy Policy, you may not use this website/service.<br>
          <br><b>1. What information we collect</b>
          <br>
          <br>There are various ways we collect information about you as a user. The following detail how we access this information:<br>
          <br>Information you provide using the website/service:<br>Boopie's Dashboard theme, such as in what way you would like the UI to look to you.<br>Preferred Language Locale, or what language you would like the information to be presented to you.<br>Your IP addressed (in situations described below).<br>Information from third-party services:<br>Your unique Discord ID.<br>Your Discord Profile Picture.<br>Your Discord Username.<br>Your Discord Servers that you share with the bot.<br><b>2. How this information is collected</b>
          <br>We collect information to provide a better experience for you as a user, and as a better authenticated process for other users.<br>
          <br>Information you provide using the website/service: Boopie's Dashboard website/service does not use data that you directly provide to the website/service for any authentication means. Instead, the data collected (preferred theme and language locale) are used only to improve your experience as a user. This includes modifying the look, feel and content of the website/service to fit how you wish for it to. This information is not necessary, and you can choose how much data you wish to be collected by choosing what settings you wish to be changed from defaults.<br>
          <br>Information provided to us about you from a third-party service: The website/service uses a third-party service’s, Discord (discord.com), Open Authentication (from here on known as “OAuth”) to collect data about your identity and to authenticate you. This is to ensure your actions are limited to only those you can access. When choosing to login through the dashboard and are redirected to Discord’s OAuth Authorization page, Discord details what information will be exposed to our website/service. If you choose to cancel the operation, no Discord data will be collected about you. If you choose to Authorize, then we will request Discord for the data detailed above in Section 1.<br>
          <br>Information provided to us about you from third-party program: website/service uses a connected instance of Red Discord Bot (from here on known as Boopie) to collect data about Discord Servers that are shared between you and the Boopie. This allows to get the necessary data to perform actions through the Boopie. This data is never stored anywhere by the Boopie's website/service and is instead loaded when you visit the appropriate page.<br>
          <br>Information that your device provides to us when visiting the website/service: Boopie's Dashboard website/service uses a variety of security measures to ensure the safety of the website/service and the safety of other users. In order to identify suspicious activity, the program may track your IP if it finds this, and is stored on a Boopie. Due to the importance of security, we are unable to automatically delete your IP address from the backend server. You must contact the Bot Owner if you wish to discuss the deletion of your device's data, and is outside the scope of us as the creators.<br>
          <br>Your information is stored on your device, through cookies. Your data is never stored in a database or on the host machine of Boopie, excluding any special-cases listed above. If you at any time wish to remove your data from the website/service, you can choose to Clear Your Cookies in your browser, but for security reasons, certain data may be kept for the safety of other users and bot owner. These are also special-cased above.<br>
          <br>Your information is never distributed to other websites/services and is instead only known to the scope of the Boopie's Dashboard website/service.<br>
          <br><b>3. Children under the Age of 13</b>
          <br>The Boopie's Dashboard website/service is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We are not aware if the user is under the age of 13 while collecting personal information about the user. If you are under the age of 13, you are not allowed to use the Boopie's Dashboard website/service.<br>
          <br><b>4. Dispute Resolution</b>
          <br>If you have any complaints, concerns or issues with this privacy policy, you should contact us first.<br>
          <br><b>5. Changes to Privacy Policy</b>
          <br>It is possible that this Privacy Policy may be updated as situations change and to satisfy legal requirements. If this happens at any time, we will attempt to notify owners through a third-party app, Discord, 30 days before such changes to privacy policies are put into effect, so that the owner may communicate to users the changes that the Privacy Policy will be experiencing.<br>
          <br><b>What data Boopie collects</b>
          <br>Boopie and the cogs included with it collect some amount of data about users for the bot’s normal operations.<br>
          <br>The bot will keep track of a short history of usernames/nicknames. It will also remember which actions were taken using your Discord account (such as creating a playlist) as well as the content of specific messages used directly as commands for the bot (such as reports sent to servers).<br>
          <br>By default, Boopie will not collect any more data than it needs, and will not use it for anything other than the portion of the Boopie's functionality that necessitated it.<br>
          <br>3rd party extensions may store additional data beyond what Red does by default. You can use the command&nbsp;<b><i>[p]mydata 3rdparty</i></b>&nbsp;to view statements about how extensions use your data made by the authors of the specific 3rd party extensions Boopie has installed.<br>
          <br>How can I delete data Red has about me?<br>The command&nbsp;<i><b>[p]mydata forgetme</b></i>&nbsp;provides a way for users to remove large portions of their own data from the bot. This command will not remove operational data, such as a record that your Discord account was the target of a moderation action.<br>
          <br>3rd party extensions to Boopie are able to delete data when this command is used as well, but this is something each extension must implement. If a loaded extension does not implement this, the user will be informed.
